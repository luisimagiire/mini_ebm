# Micro EBM
InterpreML paper is still in draft with no in-depth description about how the model works.

This repository is a simple implementation of the model described in the paper series referenced below.

Explainable Boosting Machine bare-bones implementation in minimal Python.

Small and simple, but with a lot of comments and explanations.

Do not use it for anything serious. For production, refer to InterpretML or other libraries.

## Status
- Working EBM algorithm (without FAST!)
- Need to clean up and comment the code

Requirements -> Python 3.6+ and numpy.
